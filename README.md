## Introduction
For my final Mod 3 solo project, I decided to make a tarot application. Once logged in, a user can select the card spread they would like to have and enter a question for the cards. Depending on the chosen spread, they will be shown 1,3, or 4 cards as well as an interpretation. User's can save and revisit readings. Additionally, users can view and explore the entire tarot deck.

## Set Up
- git clone this repo
- cd into that directory
- Run npm install
- Run npm start and open your browser to the indicated url
- Run npm test to view testing suite

## Directions for Use
- Login using any username/password combo
- Pick a spread (or use the default 4 card spread)
- Type in a question to ask
- Click the "ask the cards" button
- After viewing your reading, you can click the "save" button. Revisit your saved readings by clicking the "saved" button at the top of the page
- You can view the entire deck by clicking the "deck" button at the top of the page 

## Project Goals
- Use the technology Iâ€™ve been working with over the course of the module to demonstrate mastery React, Redux, Router, and Asynchronous JavaScript.
- Work within constraints to deliver a unique product for my intended audience which helps them in some way. 
- Display the data from the API in a way that applies directly to my audience
- Ability for users to store/manipulate the data displayed in the application
