### Introduction
For my final Mod 3 solo project, I decided to make a tarot application. Once logged in, a user can select the card spread they would like to have and enter a question for the cards. Depending on the chosen spread, they will be shown 1,3, or 4 cards as well as an interpretation. User's can save and revisit readings. Additionally, users can view and explore the entire tarot deck.
